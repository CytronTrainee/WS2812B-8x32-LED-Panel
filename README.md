Expansion: Cascadable / expandable using 3-pin JST SM Connectors
Module Dimensions: 80 mm (L), 320 mm (W)
Pinouts:
INPUT PORT
5V – This should be a regulated supply voltage 5VDC. More than 5.5VDC could harm the LED, less than 5V will either reduce brightness, or it just won’t turn on.
GND – The common, ground, 0V reference supply voltage.
DIN – Data from a microcontroller (or another WS2812 pixel) comes into this pin.
OUTPUT PORT
5V – This should be a regulated supply voltage 5VDC. More than 5.5VDC could harm the LED, less than 5V will either reduce brightness, or it just won’t turn on.
GND – The common, ground, 0V reference supply voltage.
DOUT – Data is shifted out of this pin, to be connected to the input of another pixel or left floating if it is the last link in the chain.
